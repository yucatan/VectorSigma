# SCbinds #
###########

What can I say? I am not a programmer, but since I was planning to bring Sigma to the 'verse of Star Citizen, first I needed it to "detect" the keybinds from the game.

After days struggling with ChatGPT I decided to write the code in a "language" I am familiar with. So I wrote SCbinds.sh (yep, Shell Script). It kindda did 95% of what
I needed. It only wouldn't create the variables in VoiceAttack. Then I asked ChatGPT 3.5 to port/convert my code to C#, in order to use it as an Inline Function in VA.
And this is the initial work (of course I needed to do a few adjustments).

Feel free to use SCbinds as it is or, in case you are feeling generous and want to contribute to the project by optimizing it (yeah those 3 temporary files are not pretty),
please let me know and I will be glad to "upgrade" the code.

Well, enough of this. Let me get back to working on Sigma-SC.
