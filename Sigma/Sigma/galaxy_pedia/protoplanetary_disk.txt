protoplanetary disk:

A protoplanetary disk is a rotating circumstellar disk of dense gas and dust surrounding a young newly formed star. The protoplanetary disk may also be considered an accretion disk for the star itself, because gases or other material may be falling from the inner edge of the disk onto the surface of the star.
