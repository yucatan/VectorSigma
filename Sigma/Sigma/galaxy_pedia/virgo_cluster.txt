Virgo Cluster, is a cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 Million light years  away in the constellation Virgo. Comprising approximately 1300 (and possibly up to 2000) member galaxies, the cluster forms the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group is an outlying member. The Local Group actually experiences the mass of the Virgo Supercluster as the Virgocentric flow.
