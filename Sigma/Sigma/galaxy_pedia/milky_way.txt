Milky Way:

The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years and is estimated to contain 100 to 400 billion stars. The very center of the galaxy is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A, which is likely to be a supermassive black hole.
