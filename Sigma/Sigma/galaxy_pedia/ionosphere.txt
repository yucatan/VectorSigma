ionosphere:

The ionosphere is a region of Earth's upper atmosphere, from about 60 kilometers (37 miles) to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) altitude, that includes the thermosphere and parts of the mesosphere and exosphere. It is ionized by solar radiation, plays an important part in atmospheric electricity and forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
