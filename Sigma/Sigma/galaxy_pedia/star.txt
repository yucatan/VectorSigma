Star:

A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. Stars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra, ranging from type O, which are very hot, to M, which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of increasing surface temperature are: M (red), K (orange), G (yellow), F (yellow white) , A (white), B (blue white) and O (blue).
