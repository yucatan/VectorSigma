Tidal force, is a force that is the secondary effect of the force of gravity, it is responsible for the phenomenon of tides. It arises because the gravitational force exerted by one body on another is not constant across it: the nearest side is attracted more strongly than the farthest side. Thus, the tidal force is differential.
