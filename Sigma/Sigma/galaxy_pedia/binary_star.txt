Binary Star:

A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called multiple star systems. These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means.

The brighter star of a visual binary is the primary star, and the dimmer is considered the secondary or companion star.
