Warp drive: it is a theoretical faster-than-light (or FTL) spacecraft propulsion system. A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude. In contrast to some other FTL technologies such as a jump drive or hyper drive, the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel between two points but involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the concept.
