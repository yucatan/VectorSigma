Airy Disk:

In optics, the Airy disk and Airy pattern are descriptions of the best focused spot of light that a perfect lens with a circular aperture can make, limited by the diffraction of light. The Airy disk is of importance in physics, optics, and astronomy.

Both Airy Disk and Airy Pattern are named after George Biddell Airy.
