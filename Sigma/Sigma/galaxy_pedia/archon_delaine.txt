Archon Delaine:

Known as the "Pirate King," Archon Delaine rose to power at age 15 and since then has begun to build the Kumo Crew into an influential criminal syndicate. In the past Archon and his crew have been active only in the Pegasi sector, but there are reports of Kumo Crew members expanding into new areas.
