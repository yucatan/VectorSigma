Onion Head: The Onion Head flower is native to HIP 55118, and its seeds contain the well-known psychedelic narcotic. Illegal in most jurisdictions.
This just goes to show that the demand for onionhead is a strong as ever, despite the Federation's attempts to quash it.

ALERT: Onion Head is illegal in most or all Federation systems.
