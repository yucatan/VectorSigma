Jotun Mookah: A small soft-furred quadruped that stains its multi-colored fur sludge brown when it dies - an action that this highly nervous creature is predisposed to do at the drop of a hat. Professional comforters must work day and night to keep this creature from self induced heart attack. The meat is extremely bitter, but they have found a niche as an expensive accessory.
