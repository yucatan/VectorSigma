Pavonis Ear Grubs: Native to the harsh desert climate, these unpleasant creatures will burrow into any soft surface, including flesh, to avoid the sun. Their resemblance of a walking human ear lead to their name. Some slavers use these grubs as a restrainer for their captives, attaching a dormant extra ear to the forehead of their slave that can be remotely triggered.
