Thargoid Sensor:
 Originally known as 'Unknown Artefacts', these strange objects are of Thargoid origin. They have the ability to repair themselves by extracting non-organic material from their immediate environment, and this self-repair mechanism can severely damage starships and other machinery. They can also scan nearby vessels and celestial bodies, and transmit information about the scanned object in an encrypted form. Since they have not been given a designation by intergalactic trade authorities, it is impossible to buy or sell them legally.
