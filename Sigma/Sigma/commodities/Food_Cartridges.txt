Food Cartridges: Cartridges for 'chefs' (cheap 3D food printers). These dehydrated components are reconstituted into a variety of shapes using a 3D printing technique. Components are mixed with water and flavourings as they are printed, according to the desired food item template for colour, texture and taste.  "Burgers" and "Hotdogs" are common standard template choices in most chefs.
