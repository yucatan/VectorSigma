Platinum Alloy: An ultra-strong metal alloy used in the manufacture of robotics, heavy machinery and weaponry. Due to the dangerous nature of mining and processing the alloy and fusing it with Platinum, most systems refused to produce it and the technique was almost lost. Now the factions of the Nahuatl system are the only people with the knowledge to create the metal.
