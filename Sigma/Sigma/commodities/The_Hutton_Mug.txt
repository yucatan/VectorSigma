The Hutton Mug: Delivered over vast distances by those in search of a profit, the Hutton Mug, is only sold to Commanders who make the painfully long journey to Hutton Orbital. Made from the salvaged frame shift drive plates of ships that ran out of fuel before reaching the station, this is purely a vanity item commemorating the epic journey. It's value lies in its rarity and latent frame shift energies keeping your drink that little bit warmer for the journey.
