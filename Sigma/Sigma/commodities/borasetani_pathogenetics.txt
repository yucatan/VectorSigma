These tiny crawling creatures have been called a lab in a bag. They exude tailored biological agents that adapt and mutate to overcome the defenses of their enemies. When deployed in large numbers they resemble a viscious yellow goo that slowly crawls over their victim devouring them completely. When there are no further nutrients to absorb the insects bocome dormant and can be recovered by specialy trained teams to be used again.
