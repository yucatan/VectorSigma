Giant Irukama Snails: Despite appearances, the species discovered on Irukama are not strictly snails. These indigenous creatures almost destroyed Irukama's native habitat over their sole predator was culled, due to the threat it posed to human settlers. Now actively managed, the surplus stock is sold on as a delicacy. The meat from a single snail can easily fill several standard-size cargo canisters.
