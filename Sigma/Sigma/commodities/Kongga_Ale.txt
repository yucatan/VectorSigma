Kongga Ale: The hops of Kongga provide a deep, satisfying flavour to the locally brewed ale, but seem to wither and spoil rapidly when removed from their native climate. Due to this Kongga Ale is renowned for its authentic flavour and traditional production methods. Served at room temperature with a decorative umbrella.
