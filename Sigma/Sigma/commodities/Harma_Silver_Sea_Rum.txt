Harma Silver Sea Rum: Based on a secret 24thÂ Century recipe taken from the log of one Captain Smolenski, Harma Silver Sea Rum has been developed by blending a range of rare alcohols to create a beverage any corsair would be proud of. The Harma Silver Cartel, who manufacture and distribute the potent brew, enjoy the controversy their product has gleaned after it became a favourite among pirate gangs across the galaxy.
