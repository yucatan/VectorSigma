Uraninite: chemical formula U O2. A radioactive ore, radioactive principally because of the small amount of the isotope U235 present. Refined into Uranium at some refineries. Uranium was used for power early in human history, using refined U235 in fission reactors, but now is mainly used for biotech applications. Illegal in some jurisdictions.
