Rare Artwork: Prized and treasured works of art. The galaxy is rife with reproductions and forgeries, and trade in the genuine articles is highly controlled, with pieces transported between owners in secure convoys. Occasionally pieces find their way onto the black market, selling for under-the-counter prices.
