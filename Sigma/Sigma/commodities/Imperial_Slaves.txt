Imperial Slaves: Slavery is an important part of Imperial Society, providing labour for the Empire and a safety net for its citizens. Many Imperials will choose to sell themselves into a fixed period of slavery than face the embarrassment and dishonour of living with a debt.

ALERT: Imperial Slaves are illegal in most systems outside of the Empire.
