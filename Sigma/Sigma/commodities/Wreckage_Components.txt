Accidents in space often leave a lot of debris, some of that wreckage should be useful in determining the cause of the accident. They should be handed in to whichever organisation has called for their collection, however they also generate some demand as morbid momentos or simply as scrap.
Since the Antares was lost 50 years ago, there have been great advances in scanning technology, and we believe it may now be possible to find the remains of the ship. We are inviting every pilot in the galaxy to deliver wreckage components to our research base at Davy Dock in the Procyon system. Once we have accumulated enough material, we will subject the debris to comprehensive analysis to determine its origin. With luck, not only will we find the remains of the Antares, we will be able to determine her fate.
