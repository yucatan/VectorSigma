Wolf Fesh: A synthetic psychoactive drug based on a closely guarded secret recipe. While active, it causes the user to lock their teeth together and rapidly exhale, a reaction that led to its street name, Fesh. There are many poor imitations but Wolf 1301 Fesh is the original and remains the most expensive due to its consistent quality. Banned in most jurisdictions.
