Esuseku Caviar: After being discovered in an ancient gene bank, the last of the cryogenically stored Sturgeon eggs were purchased for an undisclosed, but reliable enormous sum. After the long search for an appropriate environment, they were introduced to the waters of Esuseku, and to their owner's relief, hatched and established a breeding colony. The ancient fish continues to thrive in the waters of Esuseku making it the primary producer of caviar in known space.
