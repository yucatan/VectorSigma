Uranium, U, atomic number 92. Melting point 1405K. Uranium is a silvery grey metal, usually found as a mix of isotopes, mostly U238, and typically less than 1% of the radioactive U235. As a whole it is only weakly radioactive. it is chemically toxic but useful element in industry, mainly because of its density. In early human history it was used as a power source in fission reactors. Standard canisters offer sufficient protection from the low level of radiation.
