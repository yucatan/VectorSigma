Thargoid Resin: 
A bio-mechanical canister containing Thargoid resin. This substance, known as Resin, seems to be a key element in Thargoid constructions. It appears the resin can be used in various states, both to offer protection and additional strength to structures when dry, or as a lubricant in the internal systems of Thargoid bio-technology when in liquid form. When converted to a gas it is highly corrosive.
