Thargoid Probe: 
Originally known as 'Unknown Probes', these strange objects are of Thargoid origin. They are capable of emitting an electro-magnetic pulse that can temporarily incapacitate a starship. Since they have not been given a designation by intergalactic trade authorities, it is impossible to buy or sell them legally.
