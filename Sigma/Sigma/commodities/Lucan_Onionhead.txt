Lucan Onion Head: A genetically altered strain of the Onion Head flower, chemically changed to circumvent federal laws. This strain has been designed to survive in harsher climates, but its seeds contain the same well-known psychedelic narcotic. Federal lawmakers are working fast to legislate against this new breed.

ALERT: Lucan Onion Head is illegal in most or all Federation systems.
