Thargoid Hydra Tissue Sample: A sample of bio-mechanical tissue from a Thargoid Interceptor-class vessel. This sample is from the Hydra variant, and is therefore more developed than samples from other kinds of Interceptor, with denser biological matter and more intricate technological elements. Such samples are highly sought after by scientists despite being highly corrosive.
