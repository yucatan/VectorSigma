Aepyornis Egg, originally referred to as Elephant birds, these behemoths were brought out of extinction using preserved genetic material found on ancient Earth. With some careful genetic modification (before the process of gene modification was outlawed), they were adapted to thrive in a dense, oxygen-rich Cetian atmosphere. They lay prized eggs with a circumference of over a meter.
