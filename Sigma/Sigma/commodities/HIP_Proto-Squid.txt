HIP Proto Squid: Though there is no genetic link between the huge creatures of HIP 41181 and the now extinct squid once found on ancient Earth, the evolutionary similarities are remarkable. Perhaps they share some ancient space faring ancestor. There was much protest at the use of these animals as food. Claims of sentience still remain high on the agenda of those trying to stamp out the trade.
