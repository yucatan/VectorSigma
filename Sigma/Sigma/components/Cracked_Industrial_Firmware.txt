Cracked Industrial Firmware:
Captured from settlement data point networks. Known to be salvaged from signal sources. Control software for industrial hardware interfaces normally follows strict operational and installation guidelines. Cracked versions of these can be found, but are often kept secret as such industrial espionage is punished severely, making these cracks quite valuable.
