Bio-Mechanical Conduits:
Bio-mechanical power conduits removed from Thargoid ships and other technology. These conduits appear to allow for the distribution of huge amounts of energy and seem to have the ability to self repair to a certain extent. Further analysis is required, but these items might be used to enhance human technology.
