Rhenium:
Collected from mining asteroids. Rhenium is a silvery-white heavy-transition metal. Its atomic number is 75 and it was considered one of the rarest elements on Earth. More plentiful sources of the element have since been discovered and are often found when extracting other ores from asteroids. Rhenium is a valuable material in the manufacture of engines, thrusters and cooling systems.
