Abnormal Compact Emissions Data:
Discovered in private data beacons salvaged from deep space. Known to be salvaged from signal sources. Many systems compress their emissions data as it can quickly fill even massive amounts of storage. Preselected exceptions within the data set are usually kept in a lossless format and these are often of interest to other people and organisations.
