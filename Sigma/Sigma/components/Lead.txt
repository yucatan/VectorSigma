Lead:

Collected from mining asteroids. Lead is a heavy metal with a higher density than most other common materials. Although lead's toxicity has been recognised for several centuries it is still used in a large range of processes due to its low cost. Lead is used in munitions, solders, fusible alloys and radiation shielding.
