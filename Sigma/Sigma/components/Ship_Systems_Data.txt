Ship Systems Data:
Data collected from a detailed scan of a Thargoid vessel using a Xeno Scanner. This data contains information relating to the internal systems of a Thargoid ship. Research into this data is currently ongoing, with many engineers speculating that the information could hold the key to developing anti-Thargoid strategies and improve human technology to counter the threat posed by this race. Therefore, Thargoid related data is highly sought after for scientific research or can be used in the synthesis of various anti-Thargoid ammunition types.
