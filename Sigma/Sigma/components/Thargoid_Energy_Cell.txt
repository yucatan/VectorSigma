Thargoid Energy Cell:
This is an energy cell of Thargoid origin. It is found in the bodies of creatures known as Scavengers and appears to operate as both the creature's heart and energy source. It is heavily mechanised, giving the creature something akin to an internal battery and is the central component to its internal systems. This discovery has led many to question if the Scavengers are sentient creatures or simple mechanical drones created by the Thargoids as workers.
