Propulsion Elements:
Part of a Thargoid ship's propulsion system. These elements are found when damaging or fully destroying a Thargoid ship. Research into these materials is currently ongoing, with many engineers speculating that these items could hold the key to developing anti-Thargoid technologies, such as guidance systems, thrusters and ship systems. Therefore, Thargoid related materials are highly sought after for scientific research or can be used in the synthesis of various anti-Thargoid ammunition types.
