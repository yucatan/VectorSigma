Niobium:
Collected on planet surfaces and from asteroids. Niobium, N b, atomic number 41. Melting point 2750K. This element is often used in alloys, but its properties also make it useful for super-alloys needed for high temperature and extreme pressure applications. It's also used in electroceramic applications and for superconductors.
