Iron:

Collected on planet surfaces and from asteroids. Iron, F e, atomic number 26. Melting point 1811K. Iron is one of the most abundant heavier elements in the galaxy, primarily due to the formation through fusion in massive stars of nickel-56, which decays into an iron isotope. Although it isn't used as much in modern metals it still has many uses in chemical production. It's also an important element in medical molecular engineering applications.
