Thargoid Organic Circuitry:
This fragment of organic circuitry is of Thargoid origin. This item is found in the bodies of creatures known as Scavengers and appears to contain both organic and mechanical elements. This discovery has led many to question if the Scavengers are sentient creatures or simple mechanical drones created by the Thargoids as workers.
