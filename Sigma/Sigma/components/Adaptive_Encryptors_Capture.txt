Adaptive Encryptors Capture:
Discovered in private data beacons salvaged from deep space. Known to be salvaged from signal sources. Polymorphic encryption systems form a state of the art system for data encryption which are considered untraceable. There are rumours that the system has a weakness in state transition with re-encoding, and captures of these changes are eagerly sought after by some people.
