Weapon Parts:
Part of a Thargoid ship's weapon systems. These materials are found when damaging or fully destroying a Thargoid ship. Research into these materials in currently ongoing, with many engineers speculating that these items could hold the key to developing anti-Thargoid technologies such as weaponry and shielding. Therefore, Thargoid related materials are highly sought after for scientific research or can be used in the synthesis of various anti-Thargoid ammunition types.
