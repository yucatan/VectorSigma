Wreckage Components:
Part of a Thargoid ship's hull and internal structure. These materials are found when damaging or fully destroying a Thargoid ship. Research into these materials in currently ongoing, with many engineers speculating that these items could hold the key to developing anti-Thargoid technologies such as ship systems, decontamination and anti-corrosive shielding and weaponry. Therefore, Thargoid related materials are highly sought after for scientific research or can be used in the synthesis of various anti-Thargoid ammunition types.
