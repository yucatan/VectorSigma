Thargoid Technological Components:
These technological components are of Thargoid origin. These items are found in the bodies of creatures known as Scavengers and offer evidence that these creatures are heavily modified or perhaps constructed by the Thargoids. The integration of technological elements into organic entities appears to be a key element of Thargoid engineering.
