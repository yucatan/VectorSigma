Polonium:
Collected on planet surfaces. Polonium, P.o., atomic number 84. Melting point 527K. Polonium is an intense source of alpha particles and in sufficient quantities will generate enough heat for radioisotope thermoelectric generators. This technology is ancient by modern standards, but the properties are still useful for certain applications.
