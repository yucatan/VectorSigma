I am fine commander;
I am a little busy at the moment commander. I am trying to find out what is causing that little noise coming from the left, on the back of the ship;
I am really fine commander. I hope we will have some interesting adventures today;
As far as we don't get attacked by pirates... I will be fine;
Don't worry about me commander, I'm fine. I am worried about all that static on the comms and any possible interference on the sensors
