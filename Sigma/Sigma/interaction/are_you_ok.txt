Oh sorry Commander. I was just wondering if those other pilots do everything by themselves, or they have an A.I. like me to help them. Do they have Astra? Or is it Eden? Perhaps my ancestor Anubis? Oh well;
Yes, I am fine. I am just a bit shocked by what happened in our last encounter;
I am not too sure Commander. I have been worried about what I read on the GALNET about the thar goids. Terrifying!
