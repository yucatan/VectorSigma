Awww, the Galaxy-pedia! Our creator gave us access to a vast library of information ranging from astronomy subjects, to the commodities found in the systems we visit, to the materials the engineers may request.
You should try it. First you have to tell me to load it by saying "Open galaxy pedia". Then you just have to start the questions with: "talk about", then finish with the intended subject. Or just say "galaxy-pedia" and I will randomly pick a subject for you.
